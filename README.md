# prime-numbers-to-one-million
Four different threads are created and each one begins working on a subset of the numbers between 1 and one-million determining which numbers are prime. All prime numbers are added to prrimes.dat. Once the four threads complete, a report is printed to the terminal showing how many prime numbers each of the 4 threads found.
